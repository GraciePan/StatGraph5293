should actually draw the plots, not just name the type you would use.

## Base Salary

(20 points)

For this question, we will use NYC salary data found here:
<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e>

Click the Export tab then CSV.

1.  List the 10 agencies (`Agency Name`) with the highest median base
    salaries (`Base Salary`) in descending order by median base salary.

2.  Use ridgeline plots to compare the distributions of base salary
    among the top 10 agencies from part a). The agencies should be
    sorted from lowest median base salary on the bottom of the graph to
    highest median base salary on the top of the graph.

3.  Describe patterns that you observe.

4.  What information is missing or not clear from the ridgeline plots?
    Plot the data with another chart form that provides additional
    information not available in the ridgeline plots. What do you learn?
