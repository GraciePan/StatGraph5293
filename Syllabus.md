We will be using Piazza for student-to-student online class discussion. You are encouraged to post questions here first, where you can receive quick answers from your classmates. You are also encouraged to monitor the discussions and help out your classmates as much as possible. I expect the tone of the discussion to be civil and friendly and will not tolerate disrespect. For questions that require a response from an instructor, please use email.
